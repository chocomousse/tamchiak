Summary
Tamchiak is a web application that allows users to collate meal orders as a group when calling for food delivery or ordering takeaway. Users can open and close a channel for other invited users to input their meal orders. Once closed, the user who owns the channel can notify the invited users in the channel once the collated food orders have arrived for collection. Users will be able to review the cumulative and individual bills, and whether each user has paid his or her bill. Tamchiak aims to introduce greater ease to the collating of meal orders in a large group of people, as well as the splitting of bills after the orders have been collated.
